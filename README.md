#Indexing API

Text Indexer README

API that allows the user to index a text file and output an index of the words in the file, along with their definitions and frequency, to a specified file. 
There is also a GUI that can be used to display the output.

To run the program you need to enable the preview features of Java 19, either by using the command line
java --enable-preview Runner after the program has been compiled, or by enabling preview features in whatever
IDE you prefer. 

To use the API, you can either:
1. Use the menu that is loaded when you run the program
2. Launch the GUI from the menu
3. Create an object of the TextIndexer class in your project and invoke the methods from there.
The additional functionality of the program simply:
1. Print the words of the index.
2. Print the words of the index in reverse.
3. Get the total number of words.
4. Print the five most common words.
